# **Architectural Divergence in Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Comprehensive Comparative Analysis of Leela Chess Zero Training Runs 1, 2, and 3**

## **Executive Summary**

The evolution of Leela Chess Zero (Lc0) constitutes one of the most significant open-source achievements in the domain of artificial intelligence and game theory. Originating from the foundational algorithms proposed by DeepMind’s AlphaZero, the Lc0 project has diverged into a complex ecosystem of neural architectures, training methodologies, and data representations. This report provides an exhaustive, expert-level analysis of the three primary training lineages—designated as **Run 1**, **Run 2**, and **Run 3**—that have defined the project's development during the "ResNet Era" (prior to the wholesale adoption of Transformer architectures).

The analysis reveals that while **Run 1** (principally the T60 series) functioned as the "Mainline" effort dedicated to maximizing absolute playing strength via massive parameter scaling (up to ![][image1]), **Run 2** (T70 series) and **Run 3** (T75/T71 series) were established to explore orthogonal objectives. Run 2 focused on computational efficiency, distillation, and accessibility, targeting high Nodes Per Second (NPS) performance on consumer hardware. Run 3 served as an experimental testbed for radical hyperparameter tuning, alternative loss functions (such as Armageddon-specific rewards), and architectural variations that were too risky for the main lineage.

This document deconstructs these runs across four critical dimensions:

1. **Network Topology:** The specific configuration of residual blocks, filter widths, and squeeze-and-excitation layers.  
2. **Input Feature Representation:** The 112-plane standard and its temporal implications.  
3. **Head Architecture:** The divergence from scalar Value heads to Win/Draw/Loss (WDL) distributions and Moves Left Heads (MLH).  
4. **Training Data Infrastructure:** The transition from V3 to V6 binary formats and the implementation of value repair mechanisms.

**1\. Introduction: The Neural Paradigm of Leela Chess Zero**

To fully appreciate the architectural distinctions between Runs 1, 2, and 3, it is necessary to first establish the theoretical and structural baseline from which all three lineages emerged. Lc0 represents a departure from classical Alpha-Beta pruning engines (such as early Stockfish versions) by utilizing a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) as its evaluation function and move ordering oracle.

### **1.1 The Residual Network (ResNet) Backbone**

The core of the Lc0 architecture during the period covered by Runs 1, 2, and 3 is the Residual Network (ResNet). Adapted from computer vision research, the ResNet architecture solves the problem of "vanishing gradients" in deep networks by introducing skip connections—pathways that allow the gradient to bypass non-linear transformation layers during backpropagation.

In the specific context of Lc0, the network is defined by a "Tower" of residual blocks. The dimensions of this tower are the primary differentiators between the training runs. The standard notation used throughout this report is ![][image2], where:

* ![][image3] **(Filters):** The number of feature maps (channels) in each convolutional layer. This determines the "width" of the network, or its capacity to capture parallel patterns and features at each level of abstraction.  
* ![][image4] **(Blocks):** The number of residual blocks stacked sequentially. This determines the "depth" of the network, or its ability to perform sequential reasoning and compose abstract concepts from lower-level features.

Mathematically, a single residual block in Lc0 can be described as:

![][image5]  
Where ![][image6] is the input tensor, ![][image7] and ![][image8] are convolutional layers with ![][image3] filters, and the addition ![][image9] represents the residual skip connection.

### **1.2 The Role of Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)**

A pivotal architectural enhancement adopted across the major runs is the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block. While the original AlphaZero paper did not utilize SE layers, the Lc0 project integrated them to enhance the representational power of the network without a proportional increase in computational cost.

The SE block operates by explicitly modeling inter-dependencies between channels. It performs two operations:

1. **Squeeze:** Global information embedding, typically via global average pooling, to produce a channel descriptor.  
2. **Excitation:** An adaptive recalibration, using a simple gating mechanism with a sigmoid activation, to produce per-channel modulation weights.

This architecture allows the network to emphasize informative features (e.g., "King Safety" channels) and suppress less useful ones (e.g., "Queenside Pawn Structure" when the action is on the Kingside) dynamically on a move-by-move basis. The presence and configuration of SE layers became a standard in Run 1 and subsequently influenced the efficient designs of Run 2\.1

### **1.3 The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Interface**

The neural network does not operate in a vacuum; it serves as the heuristic engine for a Monte Carlo Tree Search. The network receives a board state and outputs two critical signals:

1. **Policy (![][image10]):** A probability distribution over all legal moves, acting as a prior for the search.  
2. **Value (![][image11]):** An estimation of the game outcome (typically ![][image12] or a probability distribution).

The interplay between the network's architecture and the MCTS is crucial. A larger network (Run 1\) provides a more accurate prior ![][image10] and evaluation ![][image11], allowing the MCTS to converge on the best move with fewer simulations. Conversely, a smaller network (Run 2\) provides a less accurate prior but allows for vastly more simulations (nodes) per second, potentially compensating for its "blind spots" through deeper brute-force verification.

## ---

**2\. Run 1: The Mainline (T60 Series)**

**Run 1** constitutes the primary, longest-standing training effort of the Lc0 project during the ResNet era. It is synonymous with the **T60** network series (and the earlier **T40** series). The overriding objective of Run 1 was the maximization of playing strength (Elo) in competitive environments such as the Top Chess Engine Championship (TCEC) and the Chess.com Computer Chess Championship (CCC).

### **2.1 Architectural Evolution of T60**

The T60 architecture was not static; it underwent a significant metamorphosis during the lifespan of Run 1 to adapt to the increasing availability of powerful GPU hardware (e.g., NVIDIA V100s and A100s).

#### **2.1.1 The 320x24 Era**

Initially, Run 1 utilized a ![][image13] topology. This represented a massive leap from the preceding T40 generation (![][image14]). The increase in width to 320 filters required a 56% increase in parameters per layer (![][image15]), significantly increasing the memory bandwidth requirements for inference.

This topology was selected to maximize the "knowledge capacity" of the network. In the context of chess, "width" often correlates with pattern recognition capabilities—the ability to simultaneously track multiple tactical motifs (pins, skewers, back-rank weakness) across the board.

#### **2.1.2 The Transition to 384x30**

As training progressed and Elo gains began to plateau, the architecture was further scaled to ![][image16].2 This upgrade marked the zenith of the ResNet era.

* **Filters (384):** This width allowed for an extremely rich feature space. The 384 channels in each convolutional layer provided the network with the bandwidth to encode highly specific positional nuances, such as "minority attacks in the Carlsbad structure" or "opposite-colored bishop endgames with rook support."  
* **Blocks (30):** The increase to 30 blocks deepened the network's reasoning horizon. In deep learning, depth is often associated with the level of abstraction. A 30-block tower can compose lower-level features (piece locations) into higher-level concepts (control of the center) and finally into abstract strategies (prophylaxis) more effectively than a shallower network.

### **2.2 Hyperparameter Dynamics and Training Events**

Run 1 was characterized by a dynamic training regimen, where hyperparameters were adjusted on-the-fly to destabilize local minima and encourage continued learning. Key events in the Run 1 timeline include:

* **Temperature Decay Adjustments:** The "Temperature" parameter controls the randomness of move selection during self-play data generation. Run 1 saw multiple adjustments to this schedule. For instance, at net 60584, the start temperature was reduced to 1.15, and at 60647, it was dropped to 1.1.2 Lowering temperature forces the network to play more "seriously" during training games, generating high-quality data closer to its true strength, though at the risk of reducing exploration.  
* **Multinet Activation (Brief):** Nets 60951-60955 saw the brief activation of "Multinet," an experimental architecture where the network attempts to predict outcomes from multiple different board orientations or historical states simultaneously. This was quickly deactivated due to a degradation in game generation speed, highlighting the constant tension in Run 1 between architectural complexity and training throughput.2  
* **Learning Rate Drops:** Significant architectural "settling" points occurred when the learning rate was dropped (e.g., at net 60781 to 0.015). These drops typically result in a sharp increase in Elo as the network fine-tunes its weights into a precise local minimum.2

### **2.3 Value Repair and The Rescorer**

A critical innovation that matured during Run 1 was **Value Repair**. In pure AlphaZero-style reinforcement learning, the network learns from the outcome of self-play games ![][image17]. However, self-play games can be noisy; a blunder in move 40 might turn a win into a loss, teaching the network that the opening position (move 10\) was "bad," which is incorrect.

Run 1 implemented a "Rescorer" pipeline. Instead of relying solely on the self-play result, the system would periodically re-evaluate positions from older training data using the latest, strongest network. This effectively "repaired" the training labels. The Run 1 architecture was specifically adapted to handle this via the V6 data format (discussed in Section 6), which includes fields for orig\_q (original value) to track the divergence between the old and new evaluations.3

## ---

**3\. Run 2: The Efficiency Frontier (T70 Series)**

While Run 1 chased the ceiling of performance, **Run 2** was initiated to explore the floor of computational cost. This lineage, associated with the **T70** series (including T74, T76, T77, and T79), focused on producing networks that were "strong enough" but vastly faster and more efficient.3

### **3.1 Architectural Constraints: 192x15 and 128x10**

Run 2 networks are defined by their constrained topologies. The two most common configurations in this run are:

1. ![][image18] **(Medium):** This topology is widely regarded as the "sweet spot" for consumer hardware (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 2060/3060).  
   * **Computation Reduction:** Compared to the Run 1 (![][image1]) baseline, a ![][image19] network has roughly 25% of the width (computational cost scales quadratically with width: ![][image20]) and 50% of the depth. This results in an inference speedup of approximately ![][image21].  
   * **Strategic Impact:** This speedup allows the MCTS to search 8 times as many nodes in the same time control. Run 2 explores the hypothesis that searching deeper with a slightly "dumber" network is often superior to searching shallower with a "genius" network, especially in tactical positions.  
2. ![][image22] **(Small):** Used for extreme efficiency scenarios, such as running Lc0 on mobile devices or browser-based implementations.

### **3.2 Distillation and Knowledge Transfer**

A key architectural difference in Run 2 is the heavy use of **Knowledge Distillation**. Rather than learning chess from scratch (tabula rasa) like the early Run 1 nets, many Run 2 networks were trained to mimic the outputs of a larger "Teacher" network (typically a mature Run 1 T60 net).

* **Loss Function Modification:** In distillation, the loss function includes a term that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the Student's policy distribution and the Teacher's policy distribution.  
  $$ L\_{\\text{distill}} \= \\alpha L\_{\\text{outcome}} \+ \\beta \\text{KL}(P\_{\\text{student}} |

| P\_{\\text{teacher}}) $$

* **Architectural Implication:** This allows the Run 2 architecture to "punch above its weight." Even though it lacks the parameter count to independently derive complex positional truths, it can memorize the evaluation patterns of the T60 network. This effectively compresses the knowledge of the massive Run 1 architecture into the efficient Run 2 topology.4

### **3.3 Human-Like Play and Personality**

Run 2 architectures found a secondary niche in "Human-Like" chess engines. Projects like **Maia Chess** utilize the smaller topologies (![][image23]) typical of Run 2\. The rationale is that the massive Run 1 networks are *too* perfect; their move choices are often alien and incomprehensible to humans. The restricted capacity of Run 2 networks, combined with training on human game databases (rather than self-play), results in an architecture that predicts human errors and stylistic preferences with high accuracy.5

## ---

**4\. Run 3: The Experimental Testbed (T75 & T71)**

**Run 3** represents the "skunkworks" of the Lc0 project—a parallel track used to test radical ideas, new code paths, and specialized tuning configurations that were deemed too disruptive for the stable Run 1 mainline.

### **4.1 Topology Variations: T75 and T71**

Run 3 is associated with the **T75** and **T71** network series.

* **T75:** utilized the ![][image19] topology, similar to Run 2, but generated its own training data rather than relying on distillation. This allowed developers to A/B test whether the "efficiency" of Run 2 came from the topology itself or the distillation process.3  
* **T71:** Experimented with unconventional sizes, such as ![][image24]. This specific size was an attempt to find a middle ground between the lightweight T70s and the massive T60s, aiming for a "Heavyweight" class that could still run on high-end consumer GPUs (like the RTX 2080 Ti) without the massive latency of the full T60.

### **4.2 The Armageddon Experiment (T71.5)**

One of the most distinct architectural experiments in Run 3 was the **T71.5** series, tuned specifically for **Armageddon Chess**. In Armageddon, Black has "draw odds," meaning a draw is scored as a win for Black.

* **Loss Function Engineering:** Standard Lc0 networks are trained to predict the game theoretical result (![][image25]). For T71.5, the architectural loss function was modified to skew the value targets.  
  * For White: Draw \= Loss (Target \-1.0)  
  * For Black: Draw \= Win (Target 1.0)  
* **Architectural Behavior:** This created a network with a fundamental "contempt" for draws hard-coded into its weights. Unlike standard engines that use a "Contempt Factor" during search (a heuristic adjustment), the T71.5 architecture fundamentally "believed" that a draw was equivalent to a loss/win. This demonstrates the flexibility of the Run 3 pipeline to produce specialized architectures for variant chess.3

**5\. Technical Deep Dive: Input Feature Representation**

A Neural Network's view of the world is defined by its input tensor. Across Runs 1, 2, and 3, the **112-plane** standard remained the dominant specification, but the utilization and training of these planes varied slightly based on the network's goal.

### **5.1 The 112-Plane Standard Specification**

The input to the ResNet tower is an ![][image26] tensor. This tensor is constructed by stacking "planes" of ![][image27] bitboards. The decomposition is as follows 6:

| Plane Index | Feature Description | Count |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **0 \- 103** | **History Planes** (8 Time Steps) | **104** |
|  | *Per Step:* 13 Planes |  |
|  | \- Own Pieces (P, N, B, R, Q, K) | 6 |
|  | \- Opponent Pieces (P, N, B, R, Q, K) | 6 |
|  | \- Repetition Count (1 for single, 2 for double) | 1 |
| **104 \- 111** | **Meta Planes** (Game State) | **8** |
| 104 | Castling Rights: White Kingside | 1 |
| 105 | Castling Rights: White Queenside | 1 |
| 106 | Castling Rights: Black Kingside | 1 |
| 107 | Castling Rights: Black Queenside | 1 |
| 108 | Side to Move (0=Black, 1=White) | 1 |
| 109 | 50-Move Rule Counter (Normalized) | 1 |
| 110 | Constant 0 (Reserved) | 1 |
| 111 | Constant 1 (Bias/Ones) | 1 |

### **5.2 Architectural Implications of History**

The 104 history planes represent the current position (![][image28]) and the 7 preceding positions (![][image29]).

* **Run 1 (T60) Utilization:** The massive depth of Run 1 networks allows them to effectively utilize the full 8-step history. The first convolutional block acts as a "temporal feature extractor," detecting patterns like "has the opponent just moved their knight back and forth?" (indicating a lack of a plan) or "is this position a repetition?"  
* **Run 2/3 Variations:** In experimental branches of Run 3, developers tested reducing the history to 4 steps (reducing input size to roughly 60 planes). While this reduces the computational load of the first layer, it was generally found that the 112-plane standard was optimal. The "Repetition" plane is critical; without it, the network cannot understand 3-fold repetition rules and will blunder into unwanted draws.

### **5.3 Normalization of the 50-Move Counter**

The "50-Move Rule Counter" plane (Plane 109\) is a scalar value broadcast across the ![][image27] grid.

* **Implementation:** It is typically normalized as ![][image30].  
* **Run Difference:** Run 3 experiments often involved tweaking this normalization. If the network treats the 50-move rule too linearly, it may not "panic" enough when the counter reaches 98 (49 moves). Run 3 tested non-linear activations for this plane to create a "deadline pressure" effect in the network's evaluation.

## ---

**6\. Technical Deep Dive: Training Data Binary Formats**

The architecture of the network is inextricably linked to the format of the data it consumes. The Lc0 project evolved its binary training data format from **V3** to **V6** during the timeline of Runs 1, 2, and 3\. This evolution reflects a shift in what the architects believed was important for the network to learn.

### **6.1 The V3 Format (Early Run 1\)**

* **Structure:** Compressed state \+ Policy vector \+ Game Result (![][image31]).  
* **Limitation:** V3 only stored the final outcome of the game. It did not store the internal evaluations of the MCTS (![][image32]) at each step. This meant the network was training purely on the "ground truth" of the game end, which is a high-variance signal. A brilliant move in a lost game would be labeled as "Loss" (-1), confusing the network.

### **6.2 The V4/V5 Formats (Mid Run 1, Run 2\)**

* **Innovation:** These formats introduced **Root Statistics**.  
* **Data Fields:** stored result\_q (the average value of the nodes in the MCTS search) and result\_d (the distribution of visits).  
* **Architectural Impact:** This allowed the loss function to include a term for matching the search value:  
  ![][image33]  
  This stabilized training significantly, allowing the deeper Run 1 networks to converge.

### **6.3 The V6 Format (Late Run 1, Run 3\)**

The **V6** format is the most advanced standard utilized in the ResNet era and is key to the advanced capabilities of late T60 and T75 networks.8

**V6 Struct Definition:**

C++

struct V6TrainingData {  
    float result\_q;      // MCTS Root Q (Average Value)  
    float result\_d;      // Game Result (Win/Draw/Loss)  
    float played\_q;      // Q-value of the move actually played  
    float played\_d;      // Probabilities of the move played  
    float played\_m;      // Move index  
    float orig\_q;        // Original Q-value (for Value Repair)  
    float orig\_d;        // Original Result  
    float orig\_m;        // Original Move  
    uint32\_t visits;     // Number of nodes searched  
    uint16\_t played\_idx; // Index of move in policy  
    uint16\_t best\_idx;   // Index of best move  
    float policy\_kld;    // KL Divergence (Search Complexity)  
    float best\_m;        // Best move (in plies)  
    float plies\_left;    // TARGET FOR MOVES LEFT HEAD (MLH)  
};

**Key Architectural Enablers in V6:**

1. **plies\_left:** This field is the specific target for the **Moves Left Head (MLH)**. Without V6, the MLH architecture in Run 1 could not be trained.  
2. **orig\_q:** This field enables **Value Repair**. It stores what the network *thought* the value was when the game was played. The training loop can then compare the *new* network's evaluation against this *old* evaluation to gauge progress and weight the training sample accordingly. Run 1 relied heavily on this for its "Rescorer" pipeline.  
3. **policy\_kld:** This measures the divergence between the raw network policy and the final MCTS counts. A high KLD indicates a position where the network was "surprised" by the search (i.e., the search found a move the network missed). Run 3 experiments utilized this field to perform **Prioritized Experience Replay**—training more frequently on positions with high KLD to fix the network's blind spots.

### **6.4 The "Client" and "Rescorer" Pipeline**

The training loop involves a distributed architecture.9

1. **Client (lczero-client):** Downloads the latest net, generates self-play games, and uploads them.  
2. **Server:** Receives the data.  
3. **Rescorer:** A specialized binary (often a modified lc0 engine) that processes V6 data. It recalculates the result\_q and plies\_left values using endgame tablebases (Syzygy) if the game entered a known endgame.  
   * *Note:* The Rescorer ensures that Run 1 networks have "perfect" endgame knowledge ingrained in their weights, as any tablebase position is relabeled with the exact game-theoretic outcome.3

## ---

**7\. Output Heads and Loss Architectures**

The final layer of the network, the "Head," is where the abstract features of the ResNet tower are translated into chess judgments. This is a major area of divergence between early Run 1 and later Run 1/3 architectures.

### **7.1 The Transition to WDL (Win/Draw/Loss)**

Early networks (T40, early T60) used a scalar Value head: a single neuron with a Tanh activation outputting a value in ![][image12].

* **The Draw Problem:** In high-level chess, the draw rate is extremely high (\>50%). A scalar value of 0.0 is ambiguous. It can mean:  
  1. A dead drawn opposite-colored bishop endgame (100% Draw).  
  2. A chaotic tactical mess where White wins 50% and Black wins 50% (0% Draw).  
* **WDL Architecture:** Later Run 1 (T60) and Run 3 (T75) networks adopted the **WDL Head**.  
  * **Structure:** The Value head outputs a vector of length 3 with a Softmax activation: $$.  
  * **Benefit:** This disentangles the "Draw Probability" from the "Expected Score."  
  * **Contempt Implementation:** With WDL, the engine can be configured (at search time) to calculate score as:  
    ![][image34]  
    Run 3 (Armageddon) networks tuned the *training targets* of this head to intrinsically bias the network against draws.

### **7.2 The Moves Left Head (MLH)**

The **Moves Left Head** is a distinguishing feature of the mature Run 1 architecture.12

* **Purpose:** To provide a heuristic for "conversion efficiency." In a winning position, simply knowing ![][image35] is insufficient; the engine should prefer the shortest path to mate.  
* **Architecture:**  
  * MLH is a secondary value head.  
  * It outputs a categorical distribution over logarithmic "buckets" of move counts (e.g., 1-10 moves, 10-20 moves, etc.).  
  * This is preferred over a scalar regression (predicting the exact number) because the uncertainty of game length grows exponentially with depth.  
* **Training (V6):** It trains on the plies\_left field in the V6 data.  
* **Run 2 Omission:** To save parameters and complexity, many Run 2 efficiency nets omit the MLH or use a simplified version, relying on the MCTS to handle time management naturally.

**8\. Comparative Analysis: Run 1 vs. Run 2 vs. Run 3**

This section synthesizes the technical details into a direct comparison of the three runs.

### **8.1 Table of Comparative Architectures**

| Feature | Run 1 (Mainline / T60) | Run 2 (Efficiency / T70) | Run 3 (Experimental / T75/T71) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Network Series** | T60 (and T40) | T70, T74, T76, T77, T79 | T75, T71 |
| **Max Topology** | **![][image36]** | **![][image37]** | **![][image38]** |
| **Target Hardware** | Server Class (A100, V100) | Consumer Class (RTX 3060, Mobile) | Research Clusters / Specific GPUs |
| **Primary Goal** | Maximize Elo (Absolute Strength) | Maximize Strength/Watt (Efficiency) | Test Hyperparameters / Variants |
| **Training Method** | Self-Play \+ Rescoring | Self-Play \+ Distillation | Self-Play \+ Experimental Loss |
| **Data Format** | V3 ![][image39] V6 (Full) | V5 / V6 (Often Distilled) | V6 (Experimental Fields) |
| **Value Head** | WDL \+ MLH | WDL (MLH often removed) | WDL (Modified targets, e.g., Armageddon) |
| **Input Features** | 112 Planes (Full History) | 112 Planes (Standard) | 112 (Var. history length tested) |
| **Key Innovation** | Massive Scale, Value Repair | Distillation, Human-like play | Alternative Loss Functions, T71.5 |

### **8.2 The Scaling Law Trade-off**

The relationship between Run 1 and Run 2 is governed by the **Neural Scaling Laws** of chess.

* **Run 1 (Large Nets):** Exhibit superior "Static Evaluation." They can look at a position and "know" the result without searching. This is crucial for opening theory and strategic long-term planning where search horizons are insufficient.  
* **Run 2 (Small Nets):** Rely on "Dynamic Search." They have a weaker static evaluator but can search millions of nodes per second.  
* **The Intersection:** Empirical testing showed that roughly ![][image19] (Run 2/3) is the point of diminishing returns for most time controls. While the T60 (![][image1]) is stronger at very long time controls (TCEC), the T70/T75 is often stronger at "Blitz" or "Bullet" speeds because it can clear the search overhead faster.

### **8.3 The Legacy of Run 3**

Although Run 3 was "experimental," its contributions were vital.

1. **T71.5 (Armageddon):** Proved that neural networks could be "lobotomized" via loss function tuning to play irrational chess for specific tournament scenarios.  
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The temperature schedules and learning rate drops perfected in Run 3 were back-ported to the main Run 1 training loop to squeeze the final Elo out of the T60 architecture.

## ---

**9\. Conclusion**

The architectural history of Leela Chess Zero's Runs 1, 2, and 3 is a testament to the sophistication of modern reinforcement learning pipelines. It was not merely a linear progression of "bigger is better." Instead, it was a branching evolutionary tree.

**Run 1** represents the brute-force triumph of the ResNet architecture, pushing the boundaries of parameter count (![][image1]) and input history utilization to create an entity with profound chess understanding. **Run 2** represents the engineering triumph of efficiency, proving that through distillation and careful topology selection (![][image19]), near-state-of-the-art performance could be democratized for consumer hardware. **Run 3** represents the scientific triumph of experimentation, using the V6 data format and flexible head architectures to test the fundamental limits of how a machine learns to play chess.

As the project moves into the Transformer era (T80 and beyond), the lessons learned from the "War of the Runs"—specifically the value of WDL heads, the necessity of V6-style data repair, and the efficiency of the ![][image19] sweet spot—remain foundational to the continued dominance of Lc0 in computer chess.
